# What would I change?

I think I learned alot while doing this projcet, and thats why \
I would definitely approach this problem differently this time.\
First of all, I would seperate each component so I can reuse them\
later on, also I would read more about development, so that after implementing\
alerts I would not have to redo them as I found out that they don't work on web\
Second of all, I would create better routing as in this app its clunky\
and sometimes it doesn't work as expected, or it lags a bit.
